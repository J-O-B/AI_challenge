# Stock Price Prediction

This basic app uses Yahoo finance to supply stock price data. 

A prediction can be based on a variable amount of time in the past.

To run this code, simply copy the code. In a terminal use PIP3 to install the dependencies that are listed in "Requirements.txt"

Once you have installed the dependencies simply run the file "main.py". In your terminal window, answer the questions asked:

1) Which stock you want to predict.
2) How many previous days do you want to feed into the program as "training data".
3) How many times you want your computer to train itself (epochs)

Your terminal will now display outputs of the training data, once finished training, you will see in the bottom line of your terminal "Prediction : _________" this is the estimated closing price for your selected stock. You will also be provided with a file Full.png which will display a graph. The black line is the actual stock price, the red line is what this program has predicted. 



# Minimum days that can be fed into this model is 2!

Enjoy!
